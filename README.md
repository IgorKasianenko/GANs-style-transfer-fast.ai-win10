This is style transfer Windows 10 implementation based on fast.ai [Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders, Part 2](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html), [Lesson 13](http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson13.html).

### Prerequisites

1. CUDA compatible nVidia card, the most recent Nvidia drivers. You can run without it, but it will take 10-100 times longer.
